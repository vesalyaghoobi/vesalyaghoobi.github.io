  <!-- WHY -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why Soup & Story</h2>
    <p>
      Not all frozen soups are the same. At Soup & Story, we focus on what actually matters:
      flavor, ingredients, and intention.
    </p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h2>Small-batch, cooked with care</h2>
        <p>
          Our soups are made in small batches for better texture, deeper flavor, and real attention to detail—
          the way you’d cook for people you love.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>No shortcuts</h2>
        <p>
          No preservatives. No “mystery” additives. Just real ingredients, prepared by hand and cooked slowly
          so natural flavor can speak for itself.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Balanced, nuanced flavor</h2>
        <p>
          Comforting doesn’t mean boring. Each recipe is developed to taste rich, layered, and satisfying—
          with seasonings that feel intentional, not heavy.

        <p>
          Soup & Story was born from the need for real, comforting food during a difficult time—and the belief

          hand-prepared soups designed to taste homemade and be there when you need them.
