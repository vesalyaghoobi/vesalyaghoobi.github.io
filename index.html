        <h2>About Soup & Story</h2>
        <p>
          Soup & Story was born from the need for real, comforting food during a difficult time—and the belief
          that soup, when made with care, can truly nourish. What began in a home kitchen is now a collection of
          hand-prepared soups designed to taste homemade and be there when you need them.

          <li>Minimal processing</li>
          <li>Transparent ingredients</li>
          <li>Food made by people, not factories</li>
